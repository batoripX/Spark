# Spark
A Build tool compiler made for Android so developers that develop on mobile, can use it to compile their code and build package them to an APK Spark is a 

lightweight build automation tool like gradle but simpler and is oriented through Kotlin You are free to use this for commercial or personal purposes under MIT 

License Instructions for using this: Copy the https link or a ssh if you have one And use git clone as it is a based cli tool Then run build and it will package the apk
Author notes: I wanted to make a build tool automation that packages apks compiles code builds so that developers that only have mobile devices can use this it is

gonna be really helpful as gradle is heavy to run same as cmake other build tools that are mostly meant for desktop
I do welcome contributions so feel free to help with the project ❤️
